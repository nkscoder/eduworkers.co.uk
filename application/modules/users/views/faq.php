We then contact all researchers who are qualified and experienced in your subject area and assign your work appropriately. This process usually takes less than one working day, we usually have best experts available for you straight away. We endeavour to be quicker for more urgent orders (we have one day service for really urgent cases!). Very rarely, it may take slightly longer to find an expert but we'll keep you informed of what's happening. Once we have found an expert we will inform you, and the time for the delivery of your work then begins to run. Please keep this in mind when ordering. You are then sent your completed work through your secure customer account area, before midnight, on the delivery date.</p>
